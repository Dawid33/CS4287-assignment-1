To run the model:
```
python main.py
```

## Spec

Submit a pdf describing:

1. The Data Set (2 marks)
  a. Visualisation of some of the key attributes is necessary for a top grade
  b. Any pre-processing such as normalisation applied to the data
2. The network structure and other hyperparameters (2 marks).
3. The Cost / Loss / Error / Objective function (1 mark).
4. The optimiser (1 mark).
5. Cross Fold Validation (2 marks).
6. Results â€“ accuracy and/or precision and/or recall (2 marks).
  a. Include plots if opting for a top grade.
7. Evaluation of the results (2 marks).
8. Impact of varying a hyperparameter(s) (3 marks)

Submit a Jupyter notebook with the code where:
  * The book is named CS4287-Prj1-ID1-ID2
    * Where ID1 and ID2 are the student id numbers of the team members
  * The first line in the book is a comment with names and ID numbers of the team members
  * The second line in the book should be a comment stating if the code executes to the end without an error.
  * The third line in the book should be a comment with a link to the original source where you opted to reuse an existing implementation.
  * Every critical line of code MUST be commented by YOU. To demonstrate a deep understanding of that code.


## Possible Datasets

[Hand written numbers (minst)](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
[Shannon airport weather data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghavs1003/shannon-airport-daily-data)

## TODO

- [ ] Read the dataset into python
- [ ] (Maybe?) Divide date into separate fields for year / month / day
- [ ] Normalize data
